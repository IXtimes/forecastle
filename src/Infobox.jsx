                        <h4>The weather forecast guessing game taken worldwide!</h4>
                        <div className="textContent">
                            <h2>How to Play</h2>
                            <p>Every day, we gather the weather information for a random place on the planet that was observed yesterday. The goal is to guess what the weather conditions where for that place... yesterday. <br/><br/>
                                (Ik its not a "forecast" per say but run with me).<br /><br />
                                You will get 5 guesses to predict what the weather condition was (captured at about midnight CST) as well as that day's temperature high and low, the total precipitation, and the average humidity observed throughout the day. Easy right?<br /><br />
                            By the way, you can toggle between imperial and metric units using the {isFah ? 'Â°F' : 'Â°C'} toggle on the right, in case those units are more familiar for you!
                            </p>
                            <h2>Scoring</h2>
                            <p>After you have made your guess for these estimates and press submit, you will be graded based on how close you were to the ACTUAL observed weather statistics. The highlight key is as follows:<br /><br/>
                            ðŸŸ© - Your guess is <em>close</em> enough to the actual value that its correct. You don't need to change this guess going forward.<br/><span className="detailerText">This may not be the <em>exact</em> value recorded, but its meteorology. Close enough is good enough :).</span><br/>
                            ðŸŸ¨ - Your guess is nearing the actual value, but its still a little too far off to be correct.<br/> <span className="detailerText">For temperatures this means within about {isFah ? '10Â°F' : '3Â°C'}, humidity about 10%, and precipitation {isFah ? '0.1"' : '3mm'} within the actual value!</span><br/>
                            ðŸŸ¥ - Your guess is very far off from the actual value, be more experimental with the next one!<br/><span className="detailerText">For weather conditions, anything BUT the correct answer is marked ðŸŸ¥, so just because it may be marked wrong doesn't mean you aren't close!</span><br/><br/>

                                In addition to your guess being highlighted, if it was marked as ðŸŸ¨ or ðŸŸ¥, then you are also given an arrow directing your next guess:<br/>
                                A â†‘ means the ACTUAL value is HIGHER than what you submitted, so you should guess higher next time :).<br/>
                                A â†“ means the ACTUAL value is LOWER than what you submitted, so you should guess lower next time :).<br/>
                            </p>
                            <h2>Scope</h2>
                            <p>Anywhere in the world with valid weather data (that isn't like in the middle of nowhere) is possible to be selected. You can hover over the name of the location to get some aliases that might help you better mentally pinpoint where the location is.
                                But, if you are struggling there is also a link to where the location is on Google maps.
